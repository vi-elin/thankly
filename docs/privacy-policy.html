        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last updated: December 28, 2025</p>

        <p>Welcome to Thankly ("we," "our," or "us"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring you have
            a positive experience while using our gratitude journaling application.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>Thankly is designed with privacy as a core principle. We collect and store the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Gratitude Entries:</strong> The text content of your daily gratitude entries that you create
                within the app</li>
            <li><strong>Timestamps:</strong> The date and time when you create or modify gratitude entries</li>
            <li><strong>App Settings:</strong> Your preferences including notification settings, language preferences,
                and reminder schedules</li>
            <li><strong>Local Device Data:</strong> All data is stored locally on your device using encrypted local
                storage</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>Your information is used solely for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To display your gratitude entries within the app</li>
            <li>To send you reminder notifications based on your preferences</li>
            <li>To provide app functionality and improve your user experience</li>
            <li>To maintain your settings and preferences across app sessions</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p><strong>Local Storage Only:</strong> All your data is stored exclusively on your device. We do not transmit,
            upload, or store your gratitude entries on any external servers or cloud services.</p>
        <p><strong>Security Measures:</strong> Your data is protected using industry-standard encryption methods
            provided by your device's operating system (iOS/Android).</p>
        <p><strong>Data Backup:</strong> If you use your device's built-in backup features (iCloud, Google Drive), your
            app data may be included in those backups according to your device settings.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
        <p>We do not share, sell, rent, or trade your personal information with third parties. Since all data is stored
            locally on your device, we have no access to your gratitude entries or personal information.</p>
        <p><strong>No Analytics:</strong> We do not use third-party analytics services that collect your personal data.
        </p>
        <p><strong>No Advertising:</strong> We do not display advertisements or share data with advertising networks.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
        <p>You have complete control over your data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access:</strong> You can view all your gratitude entries at any time within the app</li>
            <li><strong>Modify:</strong> You can edit or update any gratitude entry</li>
            <li><strong>Delete:</strong> You can delete individual entries or all data by uninstalling the app</li>
            <li><strong>Export:</strong> Your data remains on your device and can be backed up through your device's
                backup system</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Thankly is suitable for users of all ages. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
            Since all data is stored locally and we do not collect any information on our servers, the app can be safely
            used by children under parental guidance.</p>

        <h2>7. Notifications</h2>
        <p>The app uses local notifications to remind you to write gratitude entries. These notifications are generated
            entirely on your device and do not involve any external servers. You can control notification settings
            within the app at any time.</p>

        <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last
            updated" date at the top of this policy. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of
            the updated policy.</p>

        <h2>9. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>Your data is retained on your device until you choose to delete it or uninstall the app. We do not have
            access to or control over your data retention since everything is stored locally.</p>

        <h2>10. International Users</h2>
        <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, there are no international data transfers. Your data remains
            in your physical possession at all times.</p>
